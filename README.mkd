Perl Interface to Amazon's Route 53
===================================

The Net::Amazon::Route53 Perl module allows you to manage DNS
records for your domains via Amazon's Route 53 service.

For more information, visit http://aws.amazon.com/route53/.

In order to use this module, you will need an Amazon account,
you will need to have signed up for the Route 53 service, and
you will need the "AWS id and key" associated with your account.

You will then be able to perform the following operations, using
either the module or the handy "route53" command-line utility.

Implemented
-----------

- Use either ~/.aws-secrets or another keyfile for credentials
- Use given key and id for credentials
- Get list of hosted zones for the account
- Create a new hosted zone, optionally waiting for the request to be completed
- Delete a hosted zone, optionally waiting for the request to be completed
- Get nameservers details for a hosted zone
- List all records in a hosted zone
- List records matching a name, type, ttl or values for a hosted zone
- Delete a record matching a name, type, ttl or value for a hosted zone
- Create a new record of given name, type, ttl and value(s) for a hosted zone
- Create a "change record" option, which does a "delete" and a "create" action in one request: See Net::Amazon::Route53::ResourceRecordSet::Change.
- Support retrieving more than 100 records at once in Net::Amazon::Route53::HostedZone::resource_record_sets
